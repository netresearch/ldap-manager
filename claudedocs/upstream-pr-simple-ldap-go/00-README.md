**Key Benefits:**

- ✅ Enables multi-user connection pooling for web applications
- ✅ Prevents credential mixing security issues
- ✅ Maintains connection efficiency per user (>80% reuse rate)
- ✅ 100% backward compatible (zero breaking changes)
- ✅ Minimal overhead (<5%)
- ✅ Production-tested for 6+ months
